# Low-Pass-Filter-on-Verilog
This is a simple module implementing Low Pass Filtering in Verilog Language. 

In LPF_parameterized.v:
- The Coefficients have been generated by MATLAB.
- There are two types of LPF being implemented in parallel. One is parameterized and one is not. 
Sum and sum_reg are comparing the results of parameterized and non-parameterized code. So no need to be confused.

In LPF_tb.v:
- The data_in is generated through MATLAB as well. And stored in a file which is then being read into an array called RAMM.
